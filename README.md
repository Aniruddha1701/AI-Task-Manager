# AI-Powered Task Management System üöÄ

![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x400) <!-- Add a banner image if available -->

A **real-time task management system** powered by AI for smart task suggestions and breakdowns. Built with **Golang (Gin/Fiber)** for the backend and **TypeScript (Next.js + Tailwind CSS)** for the frontend. Deployed on **Vercel** (frontend) and **Render/Fly.io** (backend).

---

## Features ‚ú®

### Backend (Golang)
- **REST API** using Gin/Fiber.
- **JWT-based authentication** for secure user sessions.
- **PostgreSQL/MongoDB** for database management.
- **WebSockets** for real-time task updates.
- **AI-powered task breakdowns** using OpenAI/Gemini API.
- Deployed on **Render/Fly.io**.

### Frontend (TypeScript + Next.js + Tailwind CSS)
- **Next.js** (App Router) for seamless routing and server-side rendering.
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive and modern UI.
- **Real-time task dashboard** with WebSocket integration.
- **JWT authentication** handled client-side.
- **AI-powered chat** for task recommendations.
- Deployed on **Vercel**.

### Bonus Features üéØ
- **Docker & Kubernetes** for containerized deployment.
- **Slack/Discord bot integration** for task notifications.
- **Automated AI task assignment** based on priority.
- Extensive use of **AI tools** (Copilot, ChatGPT, AutoGPT) for rapid development.

### Frontend

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend` directory and add the following:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSOCKET_URL=ws://localhost:8080
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**

## AI Utilization ü§ñ

- **AI-Powered Task Suggestions:**
  - The OpenAI/Gemini API is used to generate task breakdowns and recommendations.
  - Example: When a user creates a task, the AI suggests subtasks and priorities.

- **AI Tools for Development:**
  - **GitHub Copilot** for code suggestions.
  - **ChatGPT** for debugging and documentation.
  - **AutoGPT** for automating repetitive tasks.

---

## Documentation üìÑ

### How AI Tools Helped
- **GitHub Copilot:** Accelerated development by providing code snippets and suggestions.
- **ChatGPT:** Assisted in debugging and generating documentation.
- **AutoGPT:** Automated repetitive tasks like setting up environment variables and deployment scripts.
